Be it my undergrad, the oil and gas sector or the finance sector, or my grad school. Yep! After 3 years of spending my time in the industry I decided to return back to grad school to learn more about computers, maths and LIFE! </p><p>Growing up I travelled across India and now I study in the beautiful town of Stony Brook near New York.Born to parents who adored literature, politics and economics in their own rights.I embrace my identity as a proud nationalist Indian coming from humble Bihar. This is my digital garden on second brain where I aim to make Computer Science fun and maybe informative.</p><p><p> <img class='thumbnail' style='width:200px' src='https://i.ibb.co/86mkYtd/20190413-063202.jpg'> </p><p></p><p></p></p><p></p></ul><h2 id='professional_life_'>Professional Life </h2><p><p>Completed my undergrad in Computer Science from a place to learn that gives a chance to grow(JK) VIT in 2020</br></p><p>Started working as a software engineer for ExxonMobil. I did a ton of automative work with Ansible, PI Web API and Terraform for the PI Team. Once my job was done with Production Technologies I moved to Surveillance and Optimisation after being awarded the employee of quarter. Surveillance and Optimization presented me with challenges of building a DATA LAKE for ExxonMobil and the tools at my disposal for working on this herculean task were Azure Data Factory, Snowflake, PowerBI(for Visualisation)and Azure SQL Server. I also did a bit of React and Angular for side projects at my time at Exxon.</p><p><br></p><p>In 2022 I decided to embark on a new challenge and move to Societe Generale. It was here I learnt a ton about Docker, Terraform, Ansible and Observability from the coolest lead devs like Saleem Sheik and Sreevastav Pamban(people I aspire to be like).Worked a little on enabling Observability for Societe</p><p><br></p><p>Bid farewell to Societe to come back to Stony Brook as a graduate student in computer Science</p><p><br></p><p></p></ul><h2 id='current_endaveour'>Current Endaveour</h2><p><p>I currently work on DAG based BFT protocols under the guidance of Prof. Muhammad Javad Amiri under the hood of UPenn's DB lab. A project I thorougly enjoy!</p><p></p><hr/></main><footer><p><p>Website generated using <u><a href='https://github.com/abstractxan/Mizi'>abstractxan/Mizi</a><u></p></p></footer></body></html>
